	  <h2>Cascading Style Sheets- CSS</h2>
	  <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, 
	  including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content 
	  accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of 
	  presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting 
	  by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity 
	  and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached 
	  to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its 
	  formatting..
	  Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same 
	  markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as 
	  on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on 
	  Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the 
	  content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]
	  The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which 
	  style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This 
	  cascading priority scheme is predictable. The CSS specifications are maintained 
	  by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css 
	  is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free 
	  CSS validation service for CSS documents.[5] In addition to HTML, other markup 
	  languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL.</p>

	 <h2>Syntax</h2>
     <p>CSS has a simple syntax and uses a number of English keywords to specify the 
	 names of various style properties.A style sheet consists of a list of rules. Each 
	 rule or rule-set consists of one or more selectors, and a declaration block.
